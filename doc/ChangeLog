2009-05-15 19:51  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitbase.py: Fixed a typo.

2009-05-15 19:50  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitfilter.py: Implemented the generateOnlyMerge
	  and partially the executeMergeAllLocal.  It looks promising...

2009-05-15 19:49  bulgheroni

	  file names.

2009-05-15 19:17  bulgheroni

2009-05-15 18:08  bulgheroni

	* pysub/grid/runjob-filter-tmp.sh: Added the run job for filtering.
	  This is a bit more complicated because it allows also multiple
	  input files.

2009-05-15 18:08  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitfilter.py: This is the first version able to do
	  also single job grid submission.

2009-05-15 16:42  bulgheroni

	* pysub/: submit-filter.py, pysub/__init__.py,
	  pysub/submitfilter.py, template/filter-tmp.xml: Added the first
	  version of the submit-filter.py. This will be the first one able
	  to operate in merge mode as well. It means that it can take
	  several input runs and produce one output file only.

	  For the time being tested the generate only and the all-local
	  mode in non merging mode

2009-05-15 16:37  bulgheroni

	* pysub/: submit-clusearch.py, pysub/__init__.py, pysub/error.py,
	  pysub/submitclusearch.py: Now working with submit-clusearch. This
	  has a better name wrt its predecessor submit-analysis that was
	  too vague.  For the time being only the -s and -l options are
	  implemented, but just -s is tested.

2009-05-14 20:37  bulgheroni

	* pysub/: grid/runjob-converter-tmp.sh, pysub/submitbase.py,
	  pysub/submitconverter.py: Impletemented the self.name variable.

	  universal-tmp in converter-tmp that is more meaningful.

2009-05-14 15:55  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitpedestal.py: Fixed the only two small things
	  were not working with all GRID submission.  I would like to say
	  that now also pedestal is working locally, cpu-locally and grid.

	  the checkGRIDFolder in the doPreliminaryTest method.

2009-05-14 11:29  bulgheroni

2009-05-11 19:16  bulgheroni

	* pysub/: config/config.cfg, grid/jdl-tmp.jdl,
	  grid/runjob-converter-tmp.sh, pysub/error.py,
	  pysub/submitbase.py, pysub/submitconverter.py,
	  template/universal-tmp.xml: First version of submitter able to do
	  also all-grid submission! Under testing...

2009-05-11 14:47  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitconverter.py: Should be the first stable
	  version w/o full GRID.  From now on working on this kind of

2009-05-11 12:19  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitconverter.py: Another small bug fixed.

2009-05-11 12:07  bulgheroni

	* pysub/config/config.cfg: Added the local folder section

2009-05-10 22:09  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitconverter.py: Fixed a problem with a typo. This
	  is the issue with not compiled code!

2009-05-10 20:15  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitconverter.py: Modified the process flow.  If we
	  fail to lcg-cr the first file to the GRID, try anyway to copy
	  also the second.

2009-05-10 19:47  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitconverter.py: Wrong format of a string

2009-05-10 19:46  bulgheroni

	  the severity.

2009-05-10 19:31  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitbase.py: Added the print summary table in the

	* pysub/: submit-converter.py, pysub/submitconverter.py: Added a
	  new option --verify-output that only works in cpu-local mode. It
	  is checking if the files copied on the GRID have the same md5sum
	  as the local one before deleting. Not yet implemented.

	  Added the logRunList method to log the input run list.

2009-05-09 22:05  bulgheroni

	* pysub/: submit-converter.py, pysub/submitconverter.py: Fixed the
	  problem of the mutual exclusive keep and remove inout / output

	  to a more clever naming convention.  Cleaned the log.

2009-05-09 20:44  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submittest.py: Added fake call back for testing.

2009-05-09 20:08  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/submitbase.py: Renamed the logger from Logger to
	  Base.  Added the time stamp at the beginning of the submission

2009-05-09 20:07  bulgheroni

	* pysub/config/config.cfg: Adjusted the logging level ALL

2009-05-09 20:06  bulgheroni

	* pysub/submit-test.py: Added a fake execute and end.

2009-05-09 20:06  bulgheroni

	* pysub/submit-converter.py: Beautified.  Added some documentation.
	  Added the end() call back.

2009-05-09 08:54  bulgheroni

	* doc/Doxyfile: Modified to parse all pysub.

2009-05-09 08:53  bulgheroni

	* pysub/pysub/: submitbase.py, submitconverter.py, submittest.py:
	  Added a test documentation.

2009-05-08 19:38  bulgheroni

	* pysub/: submit-converter.py, submit-test.py, config/config.cfg,
	  pysub/__init__.py, pysub/submitbase.py, pysub/submitconverter.py,
	  pysub/submittest.py, template/anafilter-tmp.xml,
	  template/analysis-tmp.xml, template/chain-tmp.xml,
	  template/eta-tmp.xml, template/filter-tmp.xml,
	  template/hitmaker-tmp.xml, template/pedestal-tmp.xml,
	  template/universal-tmp.xml: Finally a version of pysub The
	  EUTelescope Python submitter that I like.  Completely refurbished
	  the previous version because it was too messy to handle.  Now it
	  is object oriented, well defined into a package and using as many
	  python libraries as possible.

	  I'm starting moving from the old test/pysub folder all the
	  submitters to this folder because this is the right place. I'm
	  also trying to have them documented with the same Doxygen file.
	  This would be beautiful.

	  Interesting new features: --> Added optparse to simplify
	  arguments and options --> Added ConfigParse to simplify the
	  handling of different configuration --> Added logging to have
	  everything logged into a rotate file --> All the commands (but
	  the GRID ones) are taken from libraries and not     using
	  external commands

	  While porting the old submitters to the style I'll also add full
	  GRID submission.

	  This has to be considered still a work in progress commit for the
	  submit-converter.py

2009-05-08 10:23  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-conversion.py: work in progress.

2009-05-07 19:49  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-conversion.py, template/config.py: Added a
	  configuration file. This is mainly used for GRID submission.

	  Started a revision of the existing submission scripts in order to
	  be more friendly and easy to change.

	  For the time being, making modification to the
	  submit-conversion.py only.

2009-05-07 15:45  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/gear_telescope.xml: Fixed the mimotel sensitive
	  surface.

2009-04-30 18:03  jbehr

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc: It is now possible to
	  use several hit collections and an additional inputmode was
	  implemented. Inputmode 3 can be used to align a hit collection
	  (of one layer) with a track collection from the telescope. The
	  guessing of the number of planes could be more sophisticated and
	  should be improved if required. One could think of an optional
	  steering file parameter, that overwrites the automatic guessing
	  if it is set.

	* test/pysub/submit-hitmaker.py: Fixed to typos

2009-04-30 10:25  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-hitmaker.py: Fixed another small bug, the
	  output file is different from the histofile!

2009-04-30 10:04  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-hitmaker.py: Fixed a bug in the removal of the
	  log and steering files

2009-04-29 19:24  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-hitmaker.py, template/hitmaker-tmp.xml: First
	  version of the hitmaker submission script. Now in testing...

2009-04-29 17:49  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2009-04-29 17:44  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-chain.py: Added the missing definition of
	  optionKeepInput and optionKeepOutput

2009-04-29 17:24  jbehr

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: bug fix

2009-04-29 17:14  jbehr

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc: The possibility to use
	  multiple input hit collections was added to the alignment
	  processor.

2009-04-28 14:18  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2009-04-28 14:18  bulgheroni

	* doc/introduction.html: Fixed a couple of broken or missing links

2009-04-28 14:10  bulgheroni

	* doc/introduction.html: Added the missing sections.

2009-04-28 13:47  bulgheroni

	* doc/introduction.html: Working on the documentation overview.

2009-04-28 10:58  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2009-04-28 10:41  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelDUTHistograms.h, src/EUTelDUTHistograms.cc: Added
	  other 2D histograms and profiles to have the rotation along the X
	  and Y axes as well.

2009-04-27 14:46  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelXCorrelator.h: Improved the documentation.

2009-04-27 14:39  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelXCorrelator.h, src/EUTelXCorrelator.cc: Of course
	  being the first version wasn't working, but now it does!

	  Tested with the first merged analysis with DEPFET hits. The
	  correlation is clearly visible on the X axis and not on Y but I
	  think it is a problem of the hits and not of the processor.

2009-04-27 11:43  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelXCorrelator.h, src/EUTelXCorrelator.cc: Added this
	  new processor to make correlation between the telescope planes
	  and the DUT.	It requires two input hit collection (one from the
	  telescope and one from the DUT) and also needs the DUT to be
	  properly described in GEAR.

	  This is a preliminary still to be test version. Not use for
	  production please...

2009-04-27 11:41  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelExceptions.h: Added a new exception to deal with
	  invalid geometry description from GEAR.

2009-04-23 08:39  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-anafilter.py, submit-analysis.py,
	  submit-conversion.py, submit-filter.py, submit-pedestal.py: Fixed
	  another bug with the keep-input keep-output option

2009-04-23 08:39  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Modified the autodetection of detector
	  types. In 2007 data this tag was missing in the native format but
	  we only took MimoTel data.  So, we are assuming that if a file
	  doens't have the detector type tag was containing MimoTels only.

2009-04-22 16:56  jbehr

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C: The number of contours of
	  the 2d plots for the pedestal part of the macro was increased.

2009-04-21 23:59  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-eta.py, template/eta-tmp.xml: First version
	  of the submit-eta.py

2009-04-21 23:04  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-anafilter.py, submit-analysis.py,
	  submit-chain.py, submit-conversion.py, submit-filter.py,
	  submit-pedestal.py: Modified the --keep-input and --keep-output
	  options. Now they are stronger and it doesn't depend on the order
	  you specified them

2009-04-21 22:49  bulgheroni

	* CMakeLists.txt: Fixed the issue of the pede2lcio building. Thanks
	  to Jan Engels for helping

2009-04-21 00:02  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFitTuple.cc: Removed the warning message when the DUT
	  hit collection is not found because this can be done on purpose.

2009-04-21 00:01  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelTestFitter.h: Fixed a problem with Doxygen

2009-04-20 23:09  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/gear_telescope.xml: Added a generic
	  gear_telescope file. It doesn't have anything special but it can
	  be used for starting up a new one.

2009-04-20 23:07  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-conversion.py: Removed an extra space that was
	  misinterpreted by python.

2009-04-18 10:46  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-chain.py: Updated version with keep input and
	  output options

2009-04-18 09:32  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-chain.py, template/chain-tmp.xml: First
	  version of the chain submitter. This is very user friendly and
	  can be used to submit any kind of merging between LCIO files.
	  Input and output files can be either local or remote.

	  Well done!

2009-04-17 14:51  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-anafilter.py, submit-analysis.py,
	  submit-conversion.py, submit-pedestal.py: Fixed typos and minor
	  problems.

2009-04-17 14:51  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-filter.py, template/filter-tmp.xml: Added the
	  submission script for filtering input clusters.

2009-04-16 16:03  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-anafilter.py, submit-analysis.py,
	  submit-conversion.py, submit-pedestal.py,
	  template/anafilter-tmp.xml: Updated.

2009-04-15 18:12  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelFitTuple.h, src/EUTelFitTuple.cc: Added to the
	  ntuple also the measZ variable. This is to make the future ROOT
	  analysis completely independent from any geometry description.

2009-04-15 11:40  bulgheroni

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C: Add a canvas in the
	  showClusterHistogram to show also the event multiplicity.

2009-04-15 11:18  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-anafilter.py, template/anafilter-tmp.xml:
	  First version of the anafilter. Still work in progress.

2009-04-15 11:17  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-analysis.py: Fixed an issue with the generate
	  only flag.  Fixed a mistyping in a message Fixed a mistyping in a
	  file name on the GRID.

2009-04-15 11:14  bulgheroni

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/EUTelAlign.cc: Obsoleted the old EUTelAlign
	  because it has a reference to libMinuit that is not always built
	  with ROOT.

	  Added the binary target pede2lcio to produce a align-db.slcio out
	  from the milleped.res

2009-04-14 17:42  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-pedestal.py: Fixed a small bug and a couple of
	  typos

2009-04-14 17:40  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/template/universal-tmp.xml: updated!

2009-04-14 17:39  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-analysis.py, template/analysis-tmp.xml:
	  Analysis submitter... Now the translation from bash to python is
	  getting very fast!

2009-04-14 16:29  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-pedestal.py, template/pedestal-tmp.xml: Added
	  the pedestal submitter.

2009-04-14 16:29  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/submit-conversion.py: As usual corrected some leftover
	  bugs

2009-04-14 12:12  bulgheroni

	* test/pysub/: submit-conversion.py, template/universal-tmp.xml:
	  First attempt to move to a python submission system. This is
	  doing the conversion from native to lcio-raw files.

	  Now I'm porting all the other bash script to python, hopefully
	  making them a bit better.

2009-04-09 10:47  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Fixed an instability with RAW2 EUDRB
	  data.

2009-04-08 13:31  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelAlign.cc, EUTelCorrelator.cc, EUTelHitMaker.cc,
	  EUTelMille.cc: Removed the question concerning the GeoID
	  mismatch. This feature can be activated at compile time using
	  -DEUTEL_INTERACTIVE.

2009-04-08 13:29  bulgheroni

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C: The tracker histograms are
	  saved in a folder with the name of the original incoming folder.
	  This allows to have plots coming from different Fitter
	  processors.

2009-04-07 12:11  bulgheroni

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C: Fixed a problem with the
	  display of tracker histograms.

2009-04-07 11:32  bulgheroni

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C: Minor

2009-03-04 18:35  bulgheroni

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C: Fixed a mistyping.

2009-02-27 10:31  jbehr

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: bug fix in constructor. _nPlanes was
	  uninitialized. This bug should only cause a memory allocation
	  problem and the default values.

2009-02-04 10:37  jbehr

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: very tiny change

2009-02-03 16:09  jbehr

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc: The alignment processor
	  was made independent of the number of input sensors. No
	  deviations from previous alignment results observed so far.
	  Further tests are still needed!

2009-01-22 13:17  zarnecki

	* src/: EUTelHitMaker.cc, EUTelMAPSdigi.cc (v00-00-08-toto):
	  Changes to allow for small rotations in GEAR file

2009-01-01 21:39  zarnecki

	* include/TDSIntegrationStorage.h, include/TDSPixel.h,
	  include/TDSPixelsChargeMap.h, include/TDSPrecluster.h,
	  include/TDSStep.h, src/TDSPixelsChargeMap.cc (v00-00-08-toto):
	  New version of TrackDetailedSimulation

2009-01-01 21:37  zarnecki

	* src/EUTelMAPSdigi.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Modified for new TDS
	  version

2008-12-30 19:56  zarnecki

	* include/EUTelMAPSdigi.h, src/EUTelMAPSdigi.cc (v00-00-08-toto):
	  Digitization parameters defined for each plane separately

2008-12-16 14:53  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/pedestal-steer.xml (v00-00-08-toto): Updated.

2008-12-16 14:53  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Tested that
	  the old algorithms are still working in the same way.  Updated
	  the documentation explanining the new features.

2008-12-08 11:16  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Checked that
	  when working in with the FullFrame common mode algorithm the
	  output is the same as in the previous version.

	  When working in the RowWise the output is reasonable, but further
	  testing is required by experts (Julia). Moreover we have to
	  decide if we want to have some control histograms for the RowWise
	  common mode.

2008-12-06 13:46  zarnecki

	* include/TDSPixel.h (v00-00-08-toto): Temporary fix of pixel
	  numbering problem

2008-12-05 18:09  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h, include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTELESCOPE.cc, src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Implemented the RowWise common mode. But NOT
	  TESTED at ALL.

		 *** PLZ DON'T USE IT ***

2008-12-05 16:47  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h, include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTELESCOPE.cc, src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Added a new pixel masking algorithm. Pixels
	  having a too high or a too low pedestal value can be masked out
	  from the remaining analysis part.

	  To do so, the user has to add the AbsolutePedeValue label to the
	  masking algorithm and properly tune the upper and lower
	  threshold.

2008-12-05 15:56  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHitMaker.h, src/EUTelHitMaker.cc (v00-00-08-toto):
	  Adopted the new convention for plane numbering in histograms.
	  Replaced all the stringstreams with to_string.

2008-12-05 14:54  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMAPSdigi.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a serious bug. In
	  case the very first event is not leaving any hit on the first
	  event, then the procedure of plaining counting is failing.  Now
	  fixed!

2008-12-04 22:43  zarnecki

	* src/: DEPFETReader.cc, EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc, EUTelTestFitter.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): system header files added, for compatibility
	  with new gcc compiler

2008-12-04 22:40  zarnecki

	* include/TDSPixel.h (v00-00-08-toto): less operator added for
	  pixel sorting, needed by EUTelMAPSdigi

2008-12-04 22:39  zarnecki

	* src/EUTelMAPSdigi.cc, include/EUTelMAPSdigi.h (v00-00-08-toto):
	  Histograms for model tuning added, charge processing corrected

2008-12-02 12:41  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/pedestal-steer.xml (v00-00-08-toto): Uploaded
	  the new steering file for pedestal calculation.

2008-12-02 12:35  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h, include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTELESCOPE.cc, src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Implemented the possibility to have multiple
	  algorithms for the bad pixel masking to move forward to the
	  DEPFET approach.

	  Reimplemented the NoiseDistribution, the AbsoluteNoiseValue and
	  the DeadPixel algos.

	  Now all of these have their own user-selectable threshold.

	  The new pedestal and noise processor has been compared against
	  the old one (v00-00-08) using the lcio compare utility.

2008-11-28 10:36  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h, src/EUTelNativeReader.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Improved the DEPFET decoding.

2008-11-27 17:20  zarnecki

	* src/: DEPFETReader.cc, EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc, EUTelTestFitter.cc: System header
	  files added for compatibility with new gcc compiler

2008-11-27 10:13  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelAlignmentConstant.cc, EUTelHitMaker.cc,
	  EUTelNativeReader.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Very minor.

2008-11-20 19:28  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHitMaker.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Since we are not using the
	  number of detectors in the run header, I've removed the check.

2008-11-20 18:05  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterFilter.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): In order to properly deal with sensorID
	  different from the sensor position in the input collection, a
	  mutable ancillaryIndexMap has been added. This is filled with the
	  sensor ID and position taken from the noise collection. It is
	  mutable because it is used also in constant method and the
	  operator[] is only non-const.

	  Still under-test but it seems to be working, at least non
	  crashing!

2008-11-20 18:02  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMAPSdigi.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Marked all the events as
	  data event (kDE). In this way all the following EUTelescope
	  processor will not complain because of unknown event type.

2008-11-20 15:51  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a bug with the
	  status collection. It was labeled as a TrackerData while it is a
	  TrackerRawData.

2008-11-20 15:26  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterFilter.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Making it independent from the geo information
	  in the run header. The big issue here is the number of detectors
	  that is used in several places thourgh the code, especially when
	  applying the selection criteria.

	  Getting this information from the GEAR is not a good idea since
	  the number of detectors in the GEAR file can be (if there a real
	  DUT) greater than the number of detectors.

	  The only safe way is to get this number from the noise collection
	  but this was optional.  To easily fix this issue, the presence of
	  the noise collection has been made compulsory.  In case the user
	  has not a proper noise collection, (s)he can generate it using
	  the EUTelAutoPedestalNoiseProcessor.

2008-11-20 11:09  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Remove the
	  second warning in case of event of unknown type.  Asked Filip to
	  add the event type in the simulator code.

2008-11-20 09:24  bulgheroni

	* test/histograms/eutelescopeHistos.C (v00-00-08-toto): Trying to
	  fixing the display of the correct histograms using the new
	  numbering convention. Still on going...

2008-11-19 22:36  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a
	  problem with all the histogram booking.

	  Testing again...

2008-11-19 22:31  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed an
	  issue with the name of the common mode histogram.

	  Still to be tested! But tomorrow... now I go to sleep!

2008-11-19 22:03  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a
	  couple of remaining "-d".

	  Introduced the _orderedSensorIDVec that is filled in the
	  initializeGeometry.

	  Fixed a mistake in the output db collections. The sensorID of
	  these collections is now copied from the input one.

	  First attempt to have the output histogram numbered according to
	  sensorID and no more the position in the input collection
	  (remember that this is the new convention).

2008-11-19 21:33  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): On the way
	  to have a PedestalNoiseProcessor that is totally based on
	  sensorID.  First of all replaced in all histo names the "-" with
	  "_".	Replaced all the stringstream structure with to_string for
	  histo names.

2008-11-19 18:54  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Testing the new
	  sensorIDVec feature.

	  Fixed a bug concerning the case when we have a sensorID greater
	  than the number of sensors in the system.

	  On going the testing of a full procedure with ZS data.

2008-11-19 17:51  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc (v00-00-08-toto): To improve the
	  stability, both the sensorID vectors have been made compulsory.

2008-11-19 15:06  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a
	  problem a parameter name. This was probably changed by mistake
	  and it wasn't recognized. Reverted to the previous name.

2008-11-19 14:29  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h, src/EUTelNativeReader.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Modified the code in order to allow the user to
	  choose the sensorID.	Once this decision is made, the rest of the
	  analysis process is relying only on these sensorID numbers and to
	  the GEAR file description.

2008-11-19 11:59  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a
	  couple of remaining issues with the geometry initialization.

	  As for the clustering, we have an _ancillaryIndexMap relating the
	  sensorID with the position of the objects in the ancillary
	  collections.

	  Removed all the stringstream blocks to build the histogram names
	  and replace with the to_string function.

	  Replaced all the "-d" with "_d" in histogram names. The number
	  following the "_d" in histogram names are now sensorID according
	  with the new convention.

2008-11-19 09:48  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Removed the
	  _iDetector from the data member. It was there but was totally
	  meaningless.

	  In many places of the code, replaced the iDetector with sensorID.
	  It is just a matter of naming but this is clearer and easier to
	  understand.

	  Continue testing...

2008-11-18 19:40  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc,
	  include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a
	  couple of bugs in the new implementation. Mainly due to histogram
	  filling.  Verified that the output (slcio) is the same for the
	  new and the old version for all the modalities ZS, NZS and mixed.

	  Still to be verified that the histogram output is the same. Tests
	  are on going.

2008-11-18 13:29  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): On the way to
	  getting rid from the geometry information contained in the run
	  header.  The number of detector is assumed to the be sum of the
	  elements contained into the ZS and the NZS collections.  The
	  number of pixels along X and Y are now taken from GEAR.

	  Added two maps to correlate the layer index and the sensor ID in
	  the GEAR description and the position in the ancillary
	  collections with the sensorID.

	  TO BE TESTED.  This is the testing plan:

	  --> Compare the output of this new version with the old one for
	  three sets	 of data: full NZS, full ZS and MIXED.	--> Try to
	  run the simulation output because now we should have all the
	  pieces (up to clustering) already independent from the geo
	  information	  in the run header.

2008-11-18 12:05  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelRawDataSparsifier.h, src/EUTelRawDataSparsifier.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): Fixed a small bug. We were still assuming that
	  the sensor ID is a number ranging from 0 to the total number of
	  detectors - 1.

	  Added a warning message in the documentation: this processor is
	  implicitly assuming that the input rawdata collection and the
	  ancillary ones (pedestal, noise, status) are aligned according to
	  the sensorID. In other words, we are assuming that the i-th
	  element of all the collection has the same sensor ID. This is
	  very likely to be the case, because this processor was developed
	  mainly to test the ZS clustering procedure.

	  A todo entry has been also added because this limitation can be
	  easily overcome.

	* include/EUTelRawDataSparsifier.h, src/EUTelRawDataSparsifier.cc
	  (v00-00-08-toto): The total number of detector is no more taken
	  from the run header but it is assumed to be equal to the total
	  number of elements in the input collection.

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Forgot a couple
	  of stringstream.  Removed the #include <sstream> because it is no
	  more directly used in this processor.

2008-11-18 10:31  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Removed all the
	  streamstring structure and replaced them with the new to_string
	  template function.

	  IMPORTANT: replaced in all the histogram names the "-" with "_".
	  The reason for this change is that "-" cannot be contained into a
	  valid C/C++ name while "_" can. This is offering the possibility
	  to directly call the histogram from the ROOT command line.

	  The way the geometry is guessed is well described in the new
	  documentation.

2008-11-17 17:43  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (v00-00-08-toto): Getting rid
	  from the geometry in the run header. The info are still there but
	  not used.  In the PedestalNoise processor there are two
	  information concerning the geometry: --> _noOfDetector. This was
	  taken from the run header and now it is taken as the number
	  elements of the input collection.  --> min, max X and Y. These
	  were taken from the run header and now they are taken from
	  the input collection decoder.  This new version has been tested
	  calculating pedestal and noise with this new and the old version
	  and diff-ing the output ASCII file.

	* include/DEPFET_FR.h, include/Mod_DEPF.h, src/DEPFETReader.cc,

	  the Mod_DEPF.h into the DEPFET namespace.  Modified the
	  depfet_hits array in order to be compatible with the non constant
	  definition (forbidden in ISO C++). This was breaking the nightly
	  build.

2008-11-12 19:36  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMAPSdigi.h (tags: v00-00-08), src/EUTelMAPSdigi.cc:
	  Almost done with the production of a ZS data collection.

	  Implemented: - A TrackerDataMap to correlate every detectorID
	  with a pointer to a TrackerDataImpl	object. This is because we
	  are looping over the input pixel and maybe not all   planes are
	  having at least one hit.  - Each element of the _vectorOfPixels
	  is firstly moved to a EUTelSimpleSparsePixel and   later on this
	  EUTelSimpleSparsePixel is added to a EUTelSparseDataImpl that is
	  actually   linked with the TrackerDataImpl.	 Not sure this is
	  the best approach. Probably it is better to have a map linking
	  directly    detectorID to a EUTelSparseDataImpl. I'll think on
	  that over night!  - At the end of the event cycle all the
	  TrackerDataImpl objects are added to the output   collection and
	  finally to the event itself.

	  Still missing: - The procedure is actually applied only in case
	  _singleHitOutput is false. If I got it right,   this means that
	  I'm adding pixels to the output collection only at the end of the
	  pixel generation.    Honestly I like this case much more because
	  it is more similar to the have it happens also during    the
	  conversion of real data.  - Testing, TESTING, T E S T I N G. The
	  code just compiles but never even tried to run it. So   it is
	  completely untested.	- Along with testing we also need to create
	  a new SparsePixelType. The EUTelSimpleSparsePixel is	 foreseen
	  to have a "short int" value for the charge, because this is what
	  is coming out from   the ADC in the real like. Need to talk with
	  the simulation experts to understand if they	 want to provide a
	  real "double" value or if they are happy enough with the approx
	  of it   to a "short int".

	  telescope setup with detector of the same kind.

	  After a test with a mixed setup (5 MimoTel and 1 Mimosa18), it

	* include/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.h,

	  v00-00-08): To make it compatible with mixed data (RAW and ZS) as
	  well I'm now guessing the sensorID number the same way is done in
	  the EUTelCorrelator. This is requiring GEAR to be available, so
	  from now on this Processor will be built if and only if GEAR is
	  available.

	  This is not so important because if one wants to apply alignment
	  correction it is very likely he will want to make fit and so GEAR
	  is surely required.

2008-10-03 09:20  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCorrelator.h (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07),

	  Fixed a minimal memory leak.

2008-09-28 19:15  bulgheroni

	* src/pede2lcio.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07): Added a small
	  executable to be used to convert the output of pede
	  (millepede.res) into a LCIO file containing a collection of
	  alignment constants.

	  This is very useful when pede is not executed automatically by
	  EUTelMilleProcessor and consequently the alignment database is
	  not created.

2008-09-28 15:57  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  The parameters "outlierdownweighting" and "chiscut" are now

	  the fit converges better without these parameters. They can be
	  added easily by the user to improve the result if needed.

2008-09-28 00:10  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Completely remove the use of Clouds that
	  where making the binning unpredictable and very often too corse.
	  Wherever possible they have been replaced with histograms with
	  fixed witdh binning, but in the 2D density plot where the total
	  number of bins would have been exploded.

	  Now it works in a way I like.

2008-09-27 19:17  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHitMaker.h, src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: On the way of

2008-09-27 18:20  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Fixed a minor bug, but now with

2008-09-27 18:03  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCorrelator.h, src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Replaced

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07):
	  A very strange phenomenum was first observed in run 3770. In two
	  events, instead of having six boards there were only 5 of them.

	  Of course this was messing up everything in the noise
	  calculation. To avoid this, I've added a check to compare the
	  actual number of boards with the expected one. If this is false,
	  then the event is skipped.

	  information also in the output LCIO file.

2008-09-08 15:25  bulgheroni

	* doc/Doxyfile: Improved the documentation. Now all the external

2008-09-08 15:23  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h (tags: v00-00-07): Finished the
	  debugging phase. The data quality check has been carried out
	  using the output of the EUTelMimoTelReader as reference result.

	  Both current supported sensors (MimoTel and Mimosa18) and both
	  readout modalities have been tested and EUTelNativeReader is
	  perfectly working.

2008-09-08 15:21  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMimoTelReader.h (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07):
	  Flagged as deprecated.

2008-09-08 15:20  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07):
	  Implementing the marker stripping also with Mimosa18. Marked this
	  class as obsolete because the newer and better EUTelNativeReader
	  is ready to be used.

2008-09-08 12:20  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-09-05 10:02  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-09-04 21:57  bulgheroni

	* include/: EUTelNativeReader.h, EUTelPStream.h (tags: v00-00-08,
	  v00-00-07): Fixed documentation.

2008-09-04 19:52  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/: complete.cfg, minimal.cfg (utags: v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-08): Added two files with the minimal and the complete
	  configuration for the ilcinstall script

2008-09-04 19:51  bulgheroni

	* doc/: Doxyfile, introduction.html: Improved the documentation.

	* doc/: Doxyfile, introduction.html: Documentation

2008-09-04 19:18  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: The bug with the ZS marker stripping
	  was two fold. Hopefully now everything should be fixed.

2008-09-04 18:22  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Fixed a bug with the conversion of ZS
	  data.

2008-09-04 17:33  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelDUTHistograms.cc, EUTelFitHistograms.cc,
	  EUTelFitTuple.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07),
	  EUTelTestFitter.cc: Modified in order to be compatible with
	  building with GEAR and without AIDA.

2008-09-04 16:51  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-09-04 13:02  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelUpdatePedestalNoiseProcessor.cc (tags: v00-00-08,
	  v00-00-07): Removed a warning message in the building phase
	  appearing only when built w/o AIDA.

2008-09-04 12:13  bulgheroni

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/EUTelEventViewer.cc, src/EUTelMille.cc: On
	  the way to remove unneccesary dependency.

	  - Added to the CMakeLists.txt a couple of sections to have more
	  preprocessor defines in case CED, GLS and MarlinUtil are found
	  and used.

2008-09-03 14:30  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-09-02 11:38  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelEventViewer.h, src/EUTelEventViewer.cc: Modified in
	  order to draw the planes with shift correction retrieved from the
	  alignment collection.

	  * * * *	  NOT TESTED	   * * * *

2008-09-02 09:52  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-09-01 17:37  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.h (tags: v00-00-07):
	  minor

2008-09-01 17:26  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCorrelator.h, src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Made the
	  dependency from GEAR softer. Now the processor is built even if
	  GEAR is not available, but only cluster collections are used even
	  if hits are available.

2008-09-01 10:50  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: Fixed a problem with the nightly build.

2008-08-28 12:19  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Minor bugfix (only affects chi2 histograms which are not used for
	  anything).

2008-08-23 21:16  roloff

	* src/EUTelMultiLineFit.cc:
	  Bugfix: Now Chiquare set to 0 in the loop where track candidates
	  are fitted.

2008-08-23 20:46  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelEventViewer.cc: Working in progress to make the drawing
	  of the telescope with the proper sensor alignment. I'll continue
	  once back from the seaside.

	  (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07): Adopted the new #define style for
	  ILCSoft packages. We should replace any MARLIN_USE_AIDA with a
	  simpler USE_AIDA. To maintain backward compatibility I've
	  replaced all the

	  #ifdef MARLIN_USE_AIDA

	  with

	  #if defined(USE_AIDA) || defined(MARLIN_USE_AIDA)

	  In the near future, when the adoption of the new define style
	  will be completed we can simply remove the

	  || defined(MARLIN_USE_AIDA).

2008-08-23 14:25  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelExceptions.h (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07): Added a
	  new exception to be thrown when a optional dependency is missing.

2008-08-23 12:12  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-08-22 17:11  bulgheroni

	* test/correlation/: correlationAnalysis.C, rootlogon.C (utags:
	  v00-00-07, v00-00-08): Added a simple ROOT macro to display the
	  correlation plots resulting from the EUTelCorrelator processor.

2008-08-22 10:24  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-08-21 14:31  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Added also the EUTelTLUDetector
	  decoding in the BORE

2008-08-21 14:30  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h: minor

2008-08-21 14:29  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelTLUDetector.h, src/EUTelTLUDetector.cc (utags:
	  v00-00-07, v00-00-08): Add a new class to describe the TLU
	  detector. It contains only the Tags set by the EUDAQ like the
	  And, Or, Veto, DUT mask...

2008-08-21 14:27  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h: Added a few more utilities copied from the
	  eudalib. This time I've verified that compiles also without
	  USE_EUDAQ

2008-08-21 10:53  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Major improvment in the hit
	  rejection for the pedestal calculation.  See the documentation
	  for more information.

2008-08-21 10:51  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-08-20 15:51  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Another small improvements in
	  the hit rejection. If we have particles into a pedestal run it is
	  possible that a few pixels will be marked as bad because their
	  noise is inflated by the signal particle.

	  If the masking is done in the first loop, then it is impossible
	  to apply any hit rejection.  This issue deservers a bit more of
	  study.

2008-08-20 15:20  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPixelDetector.h (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07): Forgot
	  to add the new intermediate layer.

2008-08-20 15:15  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Enforced the hit rejection
	  algorithm.

2008-08-20 14:51  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h, src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Made
	  compatible with the new inheritance scheme of EUTelBaseDetector
	  and EUTelPixelDetector

2008-08-20 14:50  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelBaseDetector.h, include/EUTelMimoTelDetector.h,
	  include/EUTelMimosa18Detector.h, src/EUTelMimoTelDetector.cc,
	  src/EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc (utags: v00-00-07, v00-00-08):
	  Changed the inheritance scheme. I've inserted an intermediate
	  layer called EUTelPixelDetector in between the base detector
	  class and the real implementation (e.g. EUTelMimoTelDetector).
	  This should make the creation of other detector type (like the
	  TLU) much easier.

2008-08-20 13:25  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Fixed a small bug in the Mimotel RAW
	  conversion. The yMax field in the cell encoder was set to a wrong
	  number.

2008-08-20 11:26  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-08-19 21:38  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Conversion validation: Tested with ZS
	  MimoTel data. More tests to come, but seems to be working.

2008-08-19 21:37  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelMimoTelDetector.cc, EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc: Fixed a
	  couple of issues with the printout. Now it is nicely working!

2008-08-19 17:48  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: minor

2008-08-19 17:42  bulgheroni

	  include/EUTelMimoTelDetector.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc (tags:
	  v00-00-08, v00-00-07): minor

2008-08-19 17:39  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc, EUTelNativeReader.cc: First
	  working version. Working means that doesn't crash, not producing
	  reasonable results.

2008-08-19 15:26  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Fixed a problem with the display of out
	  of sync events

2008-08-19 14:45  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc: As above...

2008-08-19 14:34  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc: Debugging the EUTelNativeReader

2008-08-19 14:02  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2008-08-19 13:49  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h, src/EUTelNativeReader.cc:
	  Approaching to something usable. About to try it with real data.

2008-08-19 13:48  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTELESCOPE.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07): minor

2008-08-19 12:23  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h, src/EUTELESCOPE.cc: Fixed a couple of
	  issues were breaking the nightly build and present only when
	  USE_EUDAQ was not defined.

2008-08-19 10:14  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h, src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: Another
	  step forward toward the universal native reader. Still not
	  usable!

2008-08-18 17:04  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelNativeReader.h, src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: On the way
	  to have an universal native reader. Still not usable, but at
	  least it builds!

2008-08-18 17:03  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelMimoTelDetector.cc, EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc: Minor

2008-08-18 17:02  bulgheroni

	* include/: EUTelBaseDetector.h, EUTelMimoTelDetector.h,
	  EUTelMimosa18Detector.h: Fixed a mistyping in the getY* methods

2008-08-18 11:09  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelDUTHistograms.cc, EUTelFitTuple.cc: Removed the
	  annoying warning message showing up everytime Eutelescope is
	  built.

2008-08-18 11:07  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h, src/EUTELESCOPE.cc: Added the same
	  utilities available in eudaq for string manipulation. This should
	  make the handling of strings much simpler.  In case the user is
	  building Eutelescope using USE_EUDAQ then the same implementation
	  of these functions is used. Otherwise, functions with the same
	  name are implemented.

2008-08-12 10:38  bulgheroni

	* test/noise/advancedNoiseAnalysis.C (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07):
	  Small changes in the color wheel

2008-08-11 09:56  bulgheroni

	* test/noise/: Style_AdvNoise.C (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07),
	  advancedNoiseAnalysis.C, rootlogon.C (tags: v00-00-08,
	  v00-00-07): Added a ROOT macro to make advanced analysis on noise
	  figures.  To run it copy the files contained into this folder
	  into the data one and just start ROOT.

2008-08-10 14:14  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelBaseDetector.h, include/EUTelMimoTelDetector.h,
	  include/EUTelMimosa18Detector.h, src/EUTelMimoTelDetector.cc,
	  src/EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc, src/EUTelSparseCluster2Impl.cc
	  (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07): Implemented the subchannel division
	  using EUTelROI.

2008-08-06 22:37  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelBaseDetector.h, include/EUTelMimoTelDetector.h,

	  src/EUTelMimoTelDetector.cc, src/EUTelMimosa18Detector.cc,
	  src/EUTelNativeReader.cc: On the way of a better and more general
	  native decoder.

2008-07-31 09:57  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Modified the histogram names: replaced
	  the "-d" with "_d" to make the handle of such histos easier once
	  opened in ROOT. This should be done on all processors having
	  histos.

2008-07-30 15:43  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc: Fixed a small issue occuring
	  when the alignment conditions contains less planes than the input
	  file. The matching between the hit and the set of alignment
	  constants is done on the basis of the sensorID.  In the case the
	  alignment condition contains less planes than the input file
	  (e.g. only some planes have been aligned), then only the hit
	  belonging to the planes having the alignment constants are
	  corrected, the other are left as in input.

2008-07-29 23:48  roloff

	* include/EUTelMultiLineFit.h, src/EUTelMultiLineFit.cc:
	  Added second set of hits in output. One with corrected hit
	  positions used in the track fit and one with the hit positions in
	  the sensors. This is work in progress: IT COMPILES, BUT IS NOT
	  TESTED YET!!!

2008-07-29 19:11  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelEventViewer.h, src/EUTelEventViewer.cc: First
	  attempt to draw also tracks. Still to be tested.  In principle we
	  would like to shift and rotate the planes according to the
	  alignment constants but this seems to be undoable for the time
	  being.

2008-07-29 17:13  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCorrelator.h, src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Added the
	  correlation of hits along Y.	Improved the docu.  Added few
	  comments.

2008-07-29 15:38  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelAlign.cc, EUTelCalculateEtaProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelClusterFilter.cc, EUTelClusterSeparationProcessor.cc (tags:
	  v00-00-08, v00-00-07), EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelCorrelator.cc, EUTelHitMaker.cc, EUTelLineFit.cc,
	  EUTelMille.cc, EUTelMultiLineFit.cc, EUTelTestFitter.cc: Add the
	  possibility to recognize also EUTelSparseClusterImpl along with
	  the more standard EUTelFFClusterImpl.

2008-07-28 19:51  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: Fixed a problem with the error on the
	  alignment constants.

2008-07-28 18:38  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc: This version seems to be
	  working on Mixed data as well but still to be checked by the
	  experts.

2008-07-28 18:13  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc: Fixed a problem. For the
	  time being it doens't work with mixed data.

2008-07-28 15:42  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc: On the way to fix the
	  misbehvior when running with ZS data. Still under development.

2008-07-28 12:05  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelAlign.cc, EUTelMultiLineFit.cc: Changed uint into
	  size_t in order to make the code portable.

2008-07-28 10:43  bulgheroni

	* include/: EUTELESCOPE.h, eutelescope.h: Actually it was not so
	  smart to have two file named with the same spelling.	This is
	  making the installation on a case-insensitive file system nearly
	  impossible.  Since eutelescope.h contains just the definition of
	  the namespace, I've move it to to EUTELESCOPE.h

2008-07-21 19:04  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCorrelator.h, src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Work in
	  progress. First trial to have correlation plots for hit
	  collections as well.

	  Still under development.

2008-07-18 17:43  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Changed default of parameter AlignMode to 1.

2008-07-11 20:01  roloff

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Also added the possibility to specify start values for the angle
	  gamma.

2008-07-11 19:27  roloff

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Added new optional paramter "UsePedeUserStartValues". This uses
	  start values for the alignment given by the user instead of the
	  values calculated automatically from the residuals. The start
	  values are specified in the parameters "PedeUserStartValuesX" and
	  "PedeUserStartValuesY".

2008-07-11 17:53  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Grouped histograms into folder.  Probably
	  found a bug of RAIDA

2008-07-11 17:35  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCorrelator.h, src/EUTelCorrelator.cc: Added the
	  first version of the cluster correlator. This is a test commit.
	  Don't use it!

	  Work in progress....

2008-07-11 15:30  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Fixed typo.

2008-07-11 12:02  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Fixed a bug in the case the
	  user selected the AbsoluteNoiseValue as bad pixel masking
	  algorithm.

	  This is not affecting any previously done analyses.

2008-07-11 12:01  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Added a debug line to print out the
	  pivot pixel misalignment.

2008-07-11 11:05  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Modified the documentation.

2008-07-10 19:00  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc: The preliminary
	  functionality tests are successfull. Still waiting the opinion of
	  the experts.

	  Small change in the way the alignment constant is retrieved from
	  the collection.  Instead of getting the element at position
	  sensorID, it is building a lookup table containing the sensorID
	  and the position in the collection.  This should solve problem
	  using this processor with DUT sensors that are numbered
	  > 100.

2008-07-10 18:09  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelApplyAlignmentProcessor.cc: Added this new processor to
	  apply the alignment corrections. Still to be deeply tested.

2008-07-09 15:02  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc: First version of the
	  Mille processor able to save a LCIO (db) file from the ASCII
	  output file generated by pede execution.

2008-07-09 15:01  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelAlignmentConstant.h, src/EUTelAlignmentConstant.cc:
	  Added a class inheriting from LCGenericObject to store the
	  alignment constants obtained from the execution of pede.

2008-07-07 19:13  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: Before executing pede, the processor will
	  check if pede is in the path.  When executing pede, the output is
	  rerouted through the streamlog_out() so that the verbosity can be
	  controlled.

2008-07-07 19:08  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelUtil.h, src/EUTelUtil.cc: Replaced by a better and
	  simpler implementation in EUTelPStream

2008-07-07 11:38  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPStream.h: Added another file for the handling of
	  std input / output / error when calling external programs.
	  Probably this will replace the previous attempt.

2008-07-04 12:02  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelUtil.h, src/EUTelUtil.cc: Added a pair of files with
	  general utility class. For the time being I've implemented just a
	  simple class to execute external commands and collect from the
	  execution thread both the stdout and stderr.

	  Still not tested and work in progress.

2008-07-04 12:00  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelRunHeaderImpl.h: Fixed a typo.

2008-07-02 18:21  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMille.cc: Now the use can force the consistency check
	  for the number of planes.  Mainly for debug purposes.

2008-06-17 16:19  roloff

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Cleanup: Removed obsolete parameters and code.

2008-06-17 15:46  roloff

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Added new parameter "RunPede". This allows directly to run the
	  pede program from the EUTelMille processor if a steering file has
	  been created. Requires that pede is included in the $PATH
	  environment variable.  Now it is possible to align the telescope
	  typing one single command!

2008-06-16 22:04  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Bugfix.

2008-06-16 20:46  roloff

	  Now steering files for the pede program can be generated.

2008-06-12 19:24  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Important bugfix.

2008-06-11 19:27  roloff

	* include/EUTelMille.h, src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Added new optional paramter "ExcludePlanes": This allows to
	  specify a list of sensors which are not considered for the
	  alignment fit. The new feature is needed by Julia for the DEPFET
	  analysis and neccessary to study runs 2949-51.

2008-06-11 10:53  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Fixed the bug that wasn't
	  allowing to activate the AdditionalBadPixelMasking loop. Now it
	  looks like working.  Anyway this bug wasn't affecting the data
	  integrity.

2008-06-11 10:48  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Fixed the sign in the CDS calculation

2008-06-04 16:00  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Still debugging the RAW2 mode. Code
	  maturity level: critically low...

2008-06-03 15:24  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Added output for residual cuts.

2008-06-03 12:04  roloff

	* src/EUTelMille.cc:
	  Fixed memory leak which occurs when cuts on residuals are used
	  before the tracks are passed to Millepede. This does not affect
	  any previous result.

2008-05-30 15:42  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Implemented the marker removal for
	  RAW2 mode as well. The overall structure of the converter needs a
	  major revision because it is becoming more and more clusmy.  We
	  should consider to hard core the detectors configuration in the
	  code.

2008-05-22 17:24  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelDUTHistograms.cc, EUTelFitHistograms.cc,
	  EUTelFitTuple.cc, EUTelTestFitter.cc: Added a #ifdef USE_GEAR /
	  #endif block around all the code to avoid the dependece from GEAR

2008-05-21 22:28  zarnecki

	* include/EUTelTestFitter.h: More documentation added

2008-05-21 22:26  zarnecki

	  src/EUTELESCOPE.cc, src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc,
	  src/EUTelRunHeaderImpl.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07):
	  Implemented in the EUTelMimoTelReader the possibility to readout
	  also Mimosa18 sensors and the capability to decode RAW2 data.
	  I've just debugged the reader with data comining from a MimoTel,
	  so it looks like it is still working as it was, but nothing can
	  said about the new features since I still don't have any
	  realistic data to play with.

	  ======================================================== VERY
	  IMPORTANT

	  Verify that the CDS calculation in RAW2 is properly done
	  ========================================================

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc (tags: v00-00-06, v00-00-05,
	  v00-00-04): Fixed a small problem with streamlog_out when it is
	  on the same line of another if-statement.  Changed the "Found
	  pixel on a marker col" from WARNING to DEBUG, because it looks
	  like that all markers are in any case passing the thresholds.

2007-09-10 11:47  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc: Added a warning message when skipping

	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04): Implemented a new container for
	  sparse data and sparse clusters. This was driven by the need for
	  speed when performing the preliminary proximity re-clusterization
	  of sparsified data. The new EUTelSparseData2Impl is copying the
	  pixel information also into a local vector and perforiming the
	  re-clusterization on the local copy after suitable resorting.
	  This implementation is at least 5 times faster than the previous.

2007-09-04 19:49  zarnecki

2007-08-18 10:37  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Fixed the problem with the max number
	  of records. Now it is really stopping when the limit is reached.
	  Added a try/catch block around the EUDRB event decoding. In this
	  way if something goes wrong with the event decoding, the full
	  event is skipped.  To avoid memory leaks, auto_ptr is used. Still
	  not sure that the ownership release of the event is really needed
	  before the ProcessorMgr::processEvent, but it crashes otherwise.

	  (tags: v00-00-03, v00-00-02), src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Added a
	  few methods for the cluster noise. In the case of the
	  EUTelFFClusterImpl, noise values are not stored in the

2007-07-12 16:42  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCopyPedestalProcessor.cc (tags: v00-00-03, v00-00-02):

2007-07-12 16:41  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMatrixDecoder.h, src/EUTelMatrixDecoder.cc (tags:

	  v00-00-02): Added a stream (operator<<) for this class mainly for
	  debug purposes

2007-07-11 10:35  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Still another bug in the CoGShift with
	  N pixels. The problem was with numeric_limits<float >::min() that
	  is not the smallest possible floating point number, but it is the
	  smallest positive floating number. To get the real minimum you
	  have to use something like -1 * numeric_limits<float >::max().

2007-07-11 09:00  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-07-11 08:59  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMatrixDecoder.h, src/EUTelMatrixDecoder.cc: Moved
	  the templated constructor from the implementation to the
	  declaration file.

2007-07-11 08:55  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Fixed a bug in the way the charge
	  center of gravity was calculated on the first N pixel. Now it is
	  working. Slightly modified the output streamer.

2007-07-11 08:54  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc (tags: v00-00-03, v00-00-02):
	  Fixed a typo.

2007-07-11 08:53  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTELESCOPE.cc: Fixed a bug in the output streamer of the
	  ClusterQuality enumeration

2007-07-11 08:52  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Removed the getXFromIndex()...
	  methods because now it is using the EUTelMatrixDecoder, that is
	  more elegant and practical.

2007-07-10 17:07  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelEtaFunctionImpl.cc (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02): Fixed a
	  bug in the lower_bound algorithm thanks to Chiara Cappellini.

2007-07-10 16:31  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterFilter.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc: Added
	  another selection criteria based upon the cluster charge with a
	  NxN frame.

2007-07-10 09:49  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMatrixDecoder.h, src/EUTelMatrixDecoder.cc: Added
	  the EUTelMatrixDecoder class. This is a very lightweight class
	  used to decode the index position of a pixel into its x and y
	  coordinates. This class is going to replace the getXFromIndex
	  getYFromIndex getIndexFromXY methods implemented in the
	  EUTelClusteringProcessor. The main reason is that this tool can
	  be used also in another context different from the clustering.

2007-07-10 09:46  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Avoiding double displaying of anomalous
	  clusters.

2007-07-10 09:45  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Fixed a mis-printing of the cluster
	  coordinates in the print() method.

2007-07-10 09:45  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Modified the behavior of quality
	  flagging. Now clusters that are touching with other clusters are
	  immediately flagged as kMergedCluster and kIncompleteCluster.
	  Remeber that to have all merged clusters really flagged the
	  EUTelClusterSeparation should be run soon after the clustering
	  processor.

2007-07-10 09:42  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h: Fixed a bug with the
	  getYFromIndex function in the case of non null origin offset.
	  This part of code should be soon replaced by the
	  EUTelMatrixDecoder.

2007-07-09 17:26  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterSeparationProcessor.h (tags: v00-00-08,
	  v00-00-07, v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04),
	  src/EUTelClusterSeparationProcessor.cc (utags: v00-00-02,
	  v00-00-03): Modified the processor behavior in order to have an
	  input collection and an output collection instead of modifying
	  the input only. This in fact was failing everytime the processor
	  was applied on data already on disk.

2007-07-09 15:59  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-07-09 15:58  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Improved the print method with
	  formatted streams

2007-07-09 15:57  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelEUDRBReader.cc (tags: v00-00-03, v00-00-02): Added

2007-07-09 15:44  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelOutputProcessor.cc (tags: v00-00-03, v00-00-02):
	  Implemented the intermediate EORE skip.  Commented from the
	  processor constructor the part of code setting
	  LCIOOutputProcessor specific paramters. Those will be set in the
	  LCIOOutputProcessor (requires current HEAD version of Marlin).

2007-07-09 15:42  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelOutputProcessor.h (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02): Added a
	  new steering parameter to remove intermediate EORE. This can be
	  very useful for all processors are using the EORE to finalize the
	  calculation. Setting this parameter to true will leave just one
	  EORE at the end of the output file also in the case several input
	  files are merged.

2007-07-09 15:40  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHitMaker.h, src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Added some
	  processor parameters in order to change the number of pixels and
	  the shape of the cluster for the center of gravity calculation.
	  Added a bunch of histograms filled in the case the Eta function
	  correction is applied to show if the correction was successful or
	  not.

2007-07-09 15:38  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelMimoTelReader.cc, EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.cc (tags:

	  VerbosityLevels.h available in Marlin current HEAD

2007-07-09 15:35  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalculateEtaProcessor.cc: Fixed a small problem with the
	  binning boundaries

	  print(ostream) method and of the operator<< friend function.

2007-07-09 12:22  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Implemented the print(ostream) method
	  for the implementation of the operator<<. The operator<< is
	  defined in the virtual base class via the virtual print and,
	  consequently reimplemented for each inheriting class.

2007-07-09 12:20  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelFFClusterImpl.h: Added the print method for the
	  operator<< implementation

2007-07-09 12:19  bulgheroni

	  get the nummber of bins used for the Eta function storage

2007-07-09 12:16  bulgheroni

	  tag because it was conflicting with the XML parsing.

2007-07-03 16:18  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Added support for marker stripping.
	  Still to be verified, but probably fixed a terrible bug in the

	  (utags: v00-00-02, v00-00-03, v00-00-04, v00-00-05, v00-00-06):
	  Added a helper class to allow geographical cut within the

2007-06-29 11:17  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc: Added support for the new
	  EUTelHistogramManager.  Improved the protection against missing
	  collection in the event catching exceptions.

2007-06-29 11:16  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/histoinfo.xml: Added some comments to make the
	  file more human readable.  Added an "empty" section for the
	  EUTelCalculateEtaProcessor since there is no need to have dynamic
	  booking there.

2007-06-29 11:14  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Uncommented the part of code crossckecing
	  against the geometry ID, since now this is available in the GEAR
	  description.	For the time being we are using GeoID == 0, since
	  we didn't save any value in the run header. Consider adding this
	  number as a parameter of the EUTelMimoTelReader

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-28 09:32  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/histoinfo.xml: Added an example of histogram
	  information file

2007-06-28 09:31  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHistogramManager.cc: Fixed a problem with comments in
	  the <histos> block.  Removed useless debug output.

2007-06-28 09:30  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Moved the clouds conversion from the End Of
	  Run Event to the end().

2007-06-28 09:29  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Added the support for
	  EUTelHistogramManager for dynamic histogram booking.	Improved
	  the protection against bad histogram handling.

2007-06-28 09:27  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHistogramMaker.h, src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc:
	  Removed the eventBrowser part, since it is useless now that we
	  have the real event browser.	Add the support for
	  EUTelHistogramManager for dynamic histogram booking.

2007-06-28 09:25  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Added support to
	  EUTelHistogramManager for dynamic histogram booking.

2007-06-27 18:58  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-27 18:58  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHistogramManager.h, src/EUTelHistogramManager.cc:
	  Finally the EUTelHistogramManager is taking off. This class is
	  supposed to parse an XML file looking for histogram booking
	  information, in order to make the proper histo booking easier and
	  not requiring any re-build. Still to be tested into real
	  processor.

2007-06-25 18:17  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-25 18:14  bulgheroni

	* doc/introduction.html: Updating the documentation

2007-06-25 18:14  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelEventViewer.h, src/EUTelEventViewer.cc: Added a new
	  processor to display event using MarlinCED interface to CED.
	  Still to be deeply debugged.

2007-06-21 20:28  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelTestFitter.cc: Added the SkipEventException when the
	  event doesn't contain a track fullfilling all the pre-requisities
	  Improved the memory management, but still to verify with valgrind

2007-06-21 19:37  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-21 19:06  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelTestFitter.cc: Fixed some issues with memory management.
	  Now it doesn't crashes anymore, but still we need to verify the
	  output of the quality collections.

2007-06-21 19:00  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Improved the protection against not booked
	  histograms

2007-06-21 18:59  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.h,
	  src/EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.cc: Added as parameters the number of
	  pixels along x and y and the name of the input / output
	  collections.

2007-06-21 18:58  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHitMaker.h: Updated documentation

2007-06-21 18:55  bulgheroni

	* doc/introduction.html: Added instruction on how to access dCache
	  from DESY

2007-06-21 17:24  tklimk

	* src/EUTelTestFitter.cc: Added the support for EORE.  Having
	  problem with the memory management in the end().

2007-06-19 23:05  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHitMaker.h, src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Almost there,
	  there are still few thing to verify, but hits seems to be
	  properly produced now.

2007-06-19 15:50  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Fixed the annoying bug was mispelling
	  the histogram titles.

2007-06-19 12:29  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc: When skipping event because
	  of common mode limit exceeded, it is also printing the number of
	  pixel above the hit rejection threshold.

2007-06-18 23:40  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.h,
	  src/EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.cc: Finished the Strasbourg converter
	  phase 0. This is only good to analyse the data they took at DESY
	  just before our test beam. The three planes are actually just one
	  quarter each of a MimoTel and so few tricks were required to get
	  out the data. Still the signal polarity has to be investigated.

2007-06-18 00:43  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-18 00:42  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.h,
	  src/EUTelStrasMimoTelReader.cc: Added a data reader for the
	  Strasbourg DAQ. For the time being it is very specific to the
	  test beam data we have. It may become more general in the future.

2007-06-18 00:41  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHistogramManager.h, src/EUTelHistogramManager.cc:
	  First attempt to define a class for a better histogram handling
	  allowing histograms rebinning and renaming without recompiling
	  the source code. For the time being there is only the structure.
	  It is enclosed into a #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL / #endif block because
	  it shouldn't be used.

2007-06-18 00:39  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Fixed a problem with MaxRecord

2007-06-16 12:58  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelVirtualCluster.h: Added a method that was only on
	  the implementation and not in the abstract interface

2007-06-16 12:57  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHistogramMaker.h, src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Tried
	  to implement histogram filling on a event by event basis. But I'm
	  not convinced that this is the right solution.

2007-06-16 00:48  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-16 00:47  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterFilter.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc: Added
	  other three selection criteria. The cluster quality. The minimum
	  and the maximum number of cluster per detector. The last two can
	  also be used to request that there should be at least one hit per
	  plane.

2007-06-15 21:59  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Moved the histo booking within a
	  isFirstEvent() if block to avoid rebooking after the first run is
	  over

2007-06-15 19:31  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Fixed the same problem with histogram
	  title for the N pixel cluster. I really need to move the
	  histogram factory into a single class and then use it in all
	  other processor.

2007-06-15 17:04  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Fixed a problem with the optional
	  parameters

2007-06-15 17:04  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterFilter.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc: First
	  attempt to have something filtering clusters. To be continue...

2007-06-15 00:21  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Fixed a minor issue in the
	  histogram title for the ClusterN family. Replaced the stupid
	  operator+ with the standard stringstream block.

2007-06-15 00:19  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusterFilter.h, src/EUTelClusterFilter.cc: Another
	  nightly build. This processor has the important task to perform a
	  filtering on the current TrackerPulse collection. It allows to
	  remove unwanted clusters according to a fairly long list of
	  criteria. But for the time being there is just the structure of
	  the processor and nothing more. It has to be finished, if not
	  tomorrow, the day after at latest.

2007-06-14 22:54  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-14 21:49  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Now masking as bad also the
	  dead pixels (i.e. pixels with noise below a certain fraction of
	  an ADC). This may be used also for marking as bad all the
	  markers.

2007-06-14 14:36  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Moved the histoBooking in the
	  processEvent in order not to reset histograms when processing
	  more than one file at a time

2007-06-13 20:02  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelFFClusterImpl.h, include/EUTelVirtualCluster.h,
	  src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc, src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc:
	  Modified the getClusterCharge(int) in order to improve the
	  performance.

2007-06-13 16:30  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Fixed another nasty bug with the
	  cluster charge. This time was 3x3 cluster problem

2007-06-13 13:47  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Minor. The major changes is that,
	  this processor will soon disapper. As soon as I'll be sure that
	  the histograms now produced by the EUTelClusteringProcessor are
	  exactly the same as the one make by this.

2007-06-13 13:45  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Moved here the histogram filling
	  facility. It is actually useless to have a specific processor
	  (namely the EUTelHistogramMaker) to fill in clusters, when they
	  are already available here in the clustering processor. Moreover,
	  the user will found the cluster related histograms into the
	  Clustering folder in the output file. This makes a lot of sense.

2007-06-13 00:47  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-13 00:45  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Fixed a very nasty bug in the
	  getClusterCharge(int) method. Mistyped a "=" instead of a "+=".
	  Try to implement a better and more efficient method to get the
	  same result. I have something in mind...

2007-06-13 00:43  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Moved the message<DEBUG>
	  directed to the std out from the #ifdef MARLINDEBUG #endif
	  otherwise they are not working with the global message level from
	  the steering file.  The maximum allowed number of cluster per
	  detector is 256 and it is too low for source run. Introduced a
	  workaroud and instead of quitting the processor is complaining
	  with the user but still adding clusters with clusterID = 256.
	  This may introduce some problems for the tracking, but since it
	  is a source run, there will be no tracking at all.  Todo: Ask
	  Filip if is using the clusterID, otherwise I can also remove it.

2007-06-13 00:39  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc: Change the binning of the
	  debug histograms. Once again they reveal themselft very useful,
	  but at the same time we need to find a way to work with
	  autobinning!

2007-06-12 16:39  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHistogramMaker.h: Fixed a mistake with the
	  documentation and one with cvs tag

2007-06-12 16:33  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-06-12 16:32  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc, EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Fixed
	  a memory leak problem with valgrind. Actually discovered some
	  leaks in Marlin.

2007-06-12 15:56  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHistogramMaker.h, src/EUTelHistogramMaker.cc: Added
	  a new processor in order to fill in detector characterization
	  histograms. For the time being only cluster related histograms
	  are filled.

2007-06-12 15:52  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Fixed a nasty bug with the
	  bad pixel masking. I was actually using a single threshold for
	  all the sensors and this is a bad idea. Now replaced the "double
	  theshold" with a "vector<double > thresholdVec".

2007-06-12 15:49  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMimoTelReader.h, src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Added
	  the signal polarity as a processor parameter. It looks like that
	  the correct polarity is negative. Still to be verified.

2007-06-12 15:47  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusterSeparationProcessor.cc: Minor changes

2007-06-12 15:46  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelFFClusterImpl.h, include/EUTelVirtualCluster.h,
	  src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Added some useful methods to the
	  cluster class in order to obtain the seed pixel charge and the
	  total charge when only a certain number of pixel is considered

2007-06-12 00:22  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelSucimaImagerReader.cc: Removed a useless setEventType.

2007-06-12 00:21  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelEUDRBReader.h (tags: v00-00-06, v00-00-05,
	  v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02), src/EUTelEUDRBReader.cc:
	  Included the class into a #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL / #endif block in
	  order to avoid confusion with the new EUTelMimoTelReader. Both
	  those readers are going to disapper soon.

2007-06-12 00:20  bulgheroni

	* doc/Doxyfile (tags: v00-00-02): Added the USE_EUDAQ in the
	  preprocessor directives.

2007-06-12 00:19  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelMimoTelReader.h, src/EUTelMimoTelReader.cc: Added a
	  DataReader class to read the output of the EUDRB when connected
	  to a MimoTel sensor. This requires to link agaist the libeudaq
	  library.

2007-06-12 00:18  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelSparseDataImpl.h, src/EUTelSparseDataImpl.cc:
	  Started working on the sparse data container. Still not usuable
	  and enclosed within a #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL #endif block

2007-06-04 08:45  bulgheroni

	* EUTelTestFitter.geom, include/EUTelTestFitter.h,
	  src/EUTelTestFitter.cc: Added the Fitter processor provided by
	  Filip, with only very few changes in order to fit within the
	  EUTelescope framework.

2007-05-31 17:27  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated. Very close to the next tagged release.

2007-05-31 17:26  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelUpdatePedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Enforce the protection
	  mechanism against possible crashes due to no events to be used
	  for update.

2007-05-31 17:25  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalculateEtaProcessor.cc: Fixed an error with the
	  registerInputCollection method.

2007-05-31 17:24  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelVirtualCluster.h: Added the documentation of the
	  _trackerData member.

2007-05-31 17:24  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h: Added an example of
	  steering file in the documentation.

2007-05-31 17:23  bulgheroni

	* doc/introduction.html: Added this file with the new
	  documentation.

2007-05-31 17:23  bulgheroni

	* doc/Doxyfile: Added the introduction file.

2007-05-30 18:33  bulgheroni

	* doc/images/: frameOfReference.png, orientation.png,
	  orientation1.png (utags: v00-00-02, v00-00-03, v00-00-04,
	  v00-00-05, v00-00-06, v00-00-07, v00-00-08): Added some pictures
	  to the documentation.

2007-05-29 17:55  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-05-29 17:54  bulgheroni

	* src/: EUTelCalculateEtaProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelClusterSeparationProcessor.cc, EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc,
	  EUTelHitMaker.cc: Modified in order to work with the new
	  decorator pattern of the EUTelVirtualCluster.

2007-05-29 17:48  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelFFClusterImpl.h, include/EUTelVirtualCluster.h,
	  src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Modified in order to implement a real
	  decorator pattern. Now EUTelVirtualCluster does NOT inherit
	  anyfrom from TrackerDataImpl, but it has a data member of type
	  TrackerDataImpl. In this way we can manage both TrackerData
	  coming from the memory or from disk.

2007-05-29 10:55  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: [no log message]

2007-05-29 10:54  bulgheroni

	* steering-examples/analysis-steer.xml (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02): Added the
	  EUTelHitMaker processor. This is principle should be the first
	  one of he tracking-steer file, but because of a problem with
	  LCIO, for the time being it has to be the last one of the
	  analysis-steer.

2007-05-29 10:51  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc: Modified a mkdir into a
	  mkdirs, during the debug phase. As reported in bug
	  https://jira.slac.stanford.edu/browse/MAR-25 RAIDA and AIDAJNI
	  behave differently when dealing with subfolder. For the time
	  being, all the processors producing histograms are working
	  according to RAIDA behavior.

2007-05-29 10:48  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelHitMaker.h, src/EUTelHitMaker.cc: Again a work in
	  progress commit. From a very technical point of view, it looks
	  like there some sort of bug in the way tracker pulse are written
	  to disk. In fact this processor works perfectly when the input
	  collections are already in the memory, but crashes when those are
	  read from the disk. Already sent an email to Frank asking for
	  help.  From a lesser technical point of view, there are still
	  many things to be verified against the actual final geometry
	  description, especially the GeoID and the "orientation".  Again
	  still to be tested is the output in the control histograms,
	  because of some problems with RAIDA and with AIDAJNI as well.
	  When all these things will be fixed/checked, we will be ready for
	  v00-00-02!

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-02-21 15:18  bulgheroni

	* test/autopede/: GNUmakefile, README (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02,
	  v00-00-01), autopedetest.cc: Added a test program to produce a
	  sample of data to characterize the autopedestal functionalities.
	  I think it can be also used for the pedestal update processor I'm
	  going to prepare.

2007-02-21 15:08  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelAutoPedestalNoiseProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelAutoPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Added a processor to be
	  used with detectors having a flat pedestal and noise
	  distribution. In this way there is no need to make a real
	  pedestal calculation and probably a simple pedestal update
	  procedure will be needed.

2007-02-21 14:58  bulgheroni

	* src/GNUmakefile: Fixed a problem with the selection of test
	  modules.  Modified the clean target in order to clean recursively
	  also test folders.

2007-02-21 14:55  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelCalibrateEventProcessor.cc: Added a message to user when
	  events are skipped because of common mode.

2007-02-21 12:02  bulgheroni

	* test/pedestal/pedetest.cc: Added CVS tag.

2007-02-21 11:55  bulgheroni

	* test/cluster/clustertest.cc: Fixed a couple of mistakes and added
	  CVS tag.

2007-02-21 09:32  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Removed the hitStatus vector and
	  now using the status object.	Implemented the resetStatus method
	  and called before the cluster search.  Added the _totCluster
	  IntVec to store the total number of clusters found in each
	  detector.

2007-02-21 09:30  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h: Replaced un-used includes
	  with forward declarations.  Added the clusterCollectionName as a
	  processor parameter.	Added the_totCluster IntVec to store the
	  number of clusters found on each detector.  Added the resetStatus
	  method to reset the pixel status object before starting the
	  cluster search

2007-02-20 17:08  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-02-20 17:07  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h: Removed some @todo already
	  done!

2007-02-20 17:06  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelCopyPedestalProcessor.h,
	  src/EUTelCopyPedestalProcessor.cc: Added a new processor to copy
	  the pedestal/noise/status conditions to local, writable
	  collections.

2007-02-20 16:58  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Changed the default value for
	  the pedestal/noise/status conditions.

2007-02-20 12:35  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelFFClusterImpl.h, src/EUTelFFClusterImpl.cc: Added
	  the EUTelescope implementation of the Fixed Frame cluster. This
	  is just inheriting from the TrackerDataImpl class and provides
	  some tools to allow direct access to cluster information. Still
	  to be tested the charge center of mass method.

2007-02-19 12:17  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h: Fixed a mistake in the documentation.

2007-02-19 12:16  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelClusteringProcessor.cc: Moved the clustering procedure
	  into a protected method named fixedFrameClustering called by the
	  processEvent if the user selects the FIXEDFRAME algorithm.

2007-02-19 12:16  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelClusteringProcessor.h: Improved the documentation.
	  Moved the clustering procedure into a protected method named
	  fixedFrameClustering called by the processEvent if the user
	  selects the FIXEDFRAME algorithm.

2007-02-18 12:14  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-02-18 12:13  bulgheroni

	* src/GNUmakefile: Added the test target to build all test
	  utilities.

2007-02-18 12:12  bulgheroni

	* test/cluster/: GNUmakefile, README (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02,
	  v00-00-01), clustertest.cc: This simple test program is used to
	  generate both a pedestal slcio file and another slcio file in
	  which on the pedestal values a random number of clusters is
	  injected. This utility is providing a powerfull way to test the
	  cluster reconstruction capabilities of the
	  EUTelClusteringProcessor.  In particular this tool is also saving
	  a text log file listing on an event basis, the position of each
	  injected cluster.

2007-02-18 11:47  bulgheroni

	* test/pedestal/: GNUmakefile, README (tags: v00-00-08, v00-00-07,
	  v00-00-06, v00-00-05, v00-00-04, v00-00-03, v00-00-02,
	  v00-00-01), pedetest.cc: Added a test utility for the
	  EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor. This small example program is used
	  to generate a known pedestal pattern to test the pedestal
	  processor functionalities. Have a look at the code of pedetest.cc
	  and eventually adapt it to your testing conditions. To make the
	  binary file, type make at the command prompt. Running ./pedetest
	  will produce both a file.root file containing the histograms and
	  profiles describing the produced pedestal and a slcio file that
	  can be used as input for the EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor. The
	  obtained processor results can be compared with the one included
	  into file.root

	  ready for the first release.	Added the CalibrateEventProcessor.
	  This is used to remove the pedestal value from each raw data and
	  to eventually suppress the common mode.  Added the
	  ClusteringProcessor able to look for clusters into data.

2007-02-11 09:46  bulgheroni

2007-02-09 11:34  bulgheroni

	* ChangeLog: Updated.

2007-02-09 11:33  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Added a new calculation
	  algorithm (AIDAPROFILE) that requires an AIDA implementation;
	  still to be verified because of many bugs in RAIDA.  Added a new
	  masking algorithm (ABSOLUTENOISEVALUE) based on an absolute noise
	  threshold.  Fixed some problems with histogram filling.  Added an
	  experimental block to save into an external LCIO file the
	  pedestal, noise and status collection.  Still not working the
	  rewind.  There is a problem with the CellIDEncoder class to be
	  fixed.

2007-02-09 11:29  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTELESCOPE.cc: Added the static definition all newly
	  introduced constant. Changed BADPIXEL from -1 to 1 because it is
	  easier to be displayed into the Status Map histogram.

2007-02-09 11:28  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h: Improved the documentation
	  describing the newly introduced calculation algorithm.  Replaced
	  DoubleVec with FloatVec and IntVec with ShortVec because in this
	  way the can be easily assigned to the Tracker(Raw)Data final
	  results.

2007-02-09 11:24  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelExceptions.h: Added a file containing all possible
	  exceptions we can need within the Eutelescope package. All
	  exceptions are sub-classes of lcio::Exception.

2007-02-09 11:22  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTELESCOPE.h: Added some doc info.  Added some other

	  generation, but still working on that.

2007-02-07 17:25  bulgheroni

	* include/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.h: Debug up to the end of the
	  first loop and things seem to be reasonable.	Added (but not yet
	  finished) some control histograms using AIDAProcessor. So far
	  tested only with RAIDA implementation.

2007-02-07 17:25  bulgheroni

	* src/EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor.cc: Commented the throw
	  RewindDataFilesException in the end() method because otherwise
	  the execution crashes. Waiting the Frank reply on this on the
	  linear collider forum.  Debug up to the end of the first loop and
	  things seem to be reasonable.  Added (but not yet finished) some
	  control histograms using AIDAProcessor. So far tested only with
	  RAIDA implementation.

2007-02-07 17:21  bulgheroni
