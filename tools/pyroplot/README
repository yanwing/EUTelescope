pyroplot - Python ROOT plotter
A tool for selecting and generating histogram
plots and comparision plots from multiple ROOT files at once
* Requirements
** Python
   Due to its dependency on the rootpy module (see below), pyroplot
   requires a Python interpreter version 2.6 or later.
** PyROOT
   PyROOT is part of the ROOT package and is usually installed
   automatically as long as the python developer libraries are found
   during configure time. Install python-dev through your
   distribution's package manager, e.g. on Ubuntu: 

   #+begin_src shell-script
   sudo apt-get install python-dev
   #+end_src

** rootpy
   rootpy makes the ROOT Python interface more "pythonic" and easier to use.
   EUTelescope ships with a development snapshot (in ./external/pymodules/rootpy-dev).
   Alternatively, install a more up-to-date one from http://rootpy.org/install.html
* Usage

#+begin_example
usage: pyroplot.py [-h] [--version] [-l LEVEL] [--compare] [-log]
                   [--select SELECT] [--selection-from-file FILE]
                   [--one-file-per-histogram] [-o FILE/PATH] [--with-2D]
                   [--with-3D] [--list-only] [--strict]
                   files [files ...]

Python ROOT plotter - A tool for selecting and assembling histogram plots and
comparision plots from multiple ROOT files at once

positional arguments:
  files                 The files to be processed; additional info STRING to
                        be included in the plot legend can be added by
                        specifiying FILE:STRING

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -l LEVEL, --log-level LEVEL
                        Sets the verbosity of log messages where LEVEL is
                        either debug, info, warning or error
  --compare             Compare the selected histograms between files (ratio
                        plots, chi2) where the first file provides the
                        reference.
  -log, --log-scale     Uses a logarithmic scale for the y axis; only relevant
                        when not using '--compare'.
  --select SELECT, -s SELECT
                        Specify regular expression(s) for histogram selection.
  --selection-from-file FILE
                        Load list of regular expressions for histogram
                        selection from file (plain text file, one reg ex per
                        line).
  --one-file-per-histogram
                        Writes one file per histogram instead of storing all
                        plots in one single file.
  -o FILE/PATH, --output FILE/PATH
                        Output path and file name. If the file does not end in
                        '.pdf' it will be assumed to be a path and created if
                        needed. If --one-file-per-histogram is set, this will
                        be the output directory for the plots.
  --with-2D, -2D        Also loads TH2-type histograms.
  --with-3D, -3D        Also loads TH3-type and Profile2D-type histograms,
                        implies --with-2D.
  --list-only           Do not generate plots but only list objects in ROOT
                        file(s) and indicate which ones would be selected.
  --strict              Require the selection to match the full histogram path
                        and name (with implied '^' and '$') instead of only a
                        partial match.

#+end_example

* Examples
** Plot all histograms from multiple files into one pdf
   #+begin_src shell-script
   python pyroplot.py run000123*.root
   #+end_src

   This will generate plots for every root file matching "run000123*"
   and will store it into the file "overview.pdf" in the local directory.

** Plot only a selection of histograms
   #+begin_src shell-script
   python pyroplot.py --select 'detector_4/.*' run000123_clustering.root
   #+end_src

   Multiple regular expressions can be specified by repeating the
   "--select" switch. The regular expressions can alternatively also
   be saved into a text file (one per line) and loaded using the
   "--selection-from-file" switch.

   A global default selection will be used if no selection
   criteria were given; this is then loaded from the file
   'default.sel' in the pyroplot directory.

** Compare histograms from two (or more) files
   #+begin_src shell-script
   python pyroplot.py --compare --select 'detector_4/.*' run000123_clustering.root run00987_clustering.root
   #+end_src
   
   To make the output easier to interpret, additional information on
   the files can be specified using the "FILE:INFOSTRING" syntax, e.g.

   #+begin_src shell-script
   python pyroplot.py --compare run000123_clustering.root:"6GeV @ DESY" run00987_clustering.root:"120GeV at SPS"
   #+end_src

   This information will be displayed in the plots' legend.
