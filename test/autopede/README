This simple test program is used to generate a data file with some
injected clusters topping up a more or less contanst pedestal. The
output data file is aimed to test the capability of
EUTelAutoPedestalNoiseProcess to deal with pedestal and noise with a
flat distribution on the full sensor (this is more or less what is
happening with self biased MAPS sensors).

Use: 

./autopedetest basepede basenoise

where basepede is a floating value representing the mean value of the
full sensor, and basenoise is a typical value of noise for all pixels
in the sensor

data_input.slcio containing rawdata with injected random clusters to
be processed by the full chain of processors.

clustering.log containing in a text format the information about the
position of the injected clusters.

Have a look at the code in clustertest.cc and eventually modify the
global parameters to better fit your needs. For example the number of
events, the maximum number of injected clusters on a single detector,
the number of detectors....
