This small example program is used to generate a file containing the
same data structure produced by the data transfer from the VME bus of
the EUDRB board. This is used to test the validity of the
EUTelEUDRBReader processor.

It is possible to costumize the produced data file changing the global
constant in the eudrb.cc.

By default, this test program is linking against GSL (GNU Scientific
library) only for random number generator. This binding can be avoided
just commenting the first line of the GNUmakefile.
