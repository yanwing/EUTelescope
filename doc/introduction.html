/**

@page intro Introduction

This is the documentation page of the EUTelescope software
project. EUTelescope is a group of <a
href="http://ilcsoft.desy.de/marlin">Marlin</a> processors to be used
for analysis and reconstruction of data taken using the <a
href="http://www.eudet.org">EUDET</a> JRA1 pixel telescope. <br><br> The
main goal of the EUTelescope software is to go from raw data acquired
by a set of data aquisition boards to high level objects like tracks
crossing the telescope. Those tracks are used to characterized both
the telescope itself and any other position sensitive detector (DUT)
that can be inserted into the telescope setup.<br><br> The structure of
EUTelescope is very modular and the each processor is just taking care
of doing a particular task on the input collection and eventually add
other output collections that can be used by other following
processors. This approach has many advantages but some disadvantages
as well when compare against a monolithic approach where one processor
only is doing the full job from the beginning to the end (see below
@ref modular).<br><br> The main input of the full analysis chain is the
LCIO output file produced by the DAQ system containing the pixel raw
data. Along with that other data are also needed: as for example
calibration constants (pedestal and noise), eta distribution for each
sensor and alignment constants. These preparation steps (@ref
preparation) can be done using a complex conditional steering file, or
they can be processed beforehand using much simpler steering file.<br><br>
When the preparation steps are done, then the complete analysis chain
can be executed (@ref analysis).

@section modular Pros and cons of a modular approach

The basic idea of having a modular approach is to keep things as
simple as possible. Every single step of the full analysis chain that
goes from raw data to tracks can be processed step by step and the
output of each step is still self consistent and can be fed in to the
next step without any manipulation. Of course this is particularly
valuable during the debug phase when each processor has to be
controlled and checked against bugs. <br> <br> From an end user point of
view, having so many steps might result in a too complicated and
useless structure. In this case it would be better to have just one
big piece of code the user run it and the result file pops up at the
end.<br> <br> For the time being we would like to stick to the modular
approach that is also Marlin inherited and for the laziest end user,
we are providing example of complete steering files to have (almost)
everything done just launching a command.

@page cdsPage CDS calculation

CDS is a very powerful technique to reduce the noise in particle
detectors. MAPS uses CDS very extensively and even if it is based on
the difference between two following sampling of the same pixel
signal, it is worth to explain how CDS is calculated in a test beam
setup. 

@section cds3frame Calculating CDS in RAW3 mode.

When working in RAW3 mode, the EUDRB DAQ producer is streaming out for
each triggered event, three following full frames, being the trigger
accepted by the EUDRB during the second one. Oversimplifying the
situation let us start considering the detector linear. Each frame
contains all the readout pixels chronologically sorted, starting from
the first one.
<br><br>
@image html cdsraw3.png "CDS algorithm with RAW 3".
<br><br>
The trigger is arriving sometime during the readout of the second
frame. The arrow in the figure is showing which pixel is readout when
the trigger is accepted by the DAQ and <b>not the hit pixel</b>. The position
of the arrow is dividing the second frame in two parts:
@li the preceding one (<b>region 1</b>) made by pixels that are
already readout at the trigger time,
@li the following part (<b>region 2</b>) made by pixels that are readout after the trigger.

A priori, we do not know whether the particle is passing through the
detector and consequently we have to analyze both region 1 and 2
separately. If it is on region 1, the signal will
pop up only at the next reading, so during the first part of the third
frame (yellow part in the picture). Instead, if it is on region 2,
the particle signal is going to be sampled and then as reference
signal the second part of the first frame should be used (cyan part in
the picture).
<br>
The EUDRB is making available the trigger arrival position. To simplify the
calculation, the EUDRB producer via the EUDRBDecoder::GetArrays is
providing four vectors with one component per pixel.
@li @c "m_adc[0]", @c "m_adc[1]", @c "m_adc[2]" contain the reading of the
first, second and third frames respectively.
@li @c "m_pivot" is an array of boolean, that is 0 till the trigger
arrival and then it is 1 till the end.
