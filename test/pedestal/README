This small example program is used to generate a known pedestal
pattern to test the pedestal processor functionalities. Have a look at
the code of pedetest.cc and eventually adapt it to your testing
conditions.

To make the binary file, type make at the command prompt.

Running ./pedetest will produce both a file.root file containing the
histograms and profiles describing the produced pedestal and a slcio
file that can be used as input for the
EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor. The obtained processor results can be
compared with the one included into file.root
