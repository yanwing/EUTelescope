This simple test program is used to generate both a pedestal slcio
file and another slcio file in which on the pedestal values a random
number of clusters is injected. This utility is providing a powerfull
way to test the cluster reconstruction capabilities of the
EUTelClusteringProcessor.  In particular this tool is also saving a
text log file listing on an event basis, the position of each injected
cluster. 

A similar log file can also be produced using the
EUTelClusteringProcessor uncommenting all the debug lines.

To build the test executable, type make from the command prompt.

The test usage is summarized in the following:

./clustertest pede       to produce only the pedestal file
./clustertest data       to produce only the data file
./clustertest pede data  to produce both!

The produced test files are the following:

pede_input.slcio containing rawdata to be processed by the
EUTelPedestalNoiseProcessor

data_input.slcio containing rawdata with injected random clusters to
be processed by the full chain of processors.

clustering.log containing in a text format the information about the
position of the injected clusters.

Have a look at the code in clustertest.cc and eventually modify the
global parameters to better fit your needs. For example the number of
events, the maximum number of injected clusters on a single detector,
the number of detectors....
