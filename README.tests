EUTelescope uses the CMake/CTest framework for daily automated,
data-driven tests to constantly verify the validity of the output. The
basis for the tests are the examples provided with the software
together with a real data sample and the expected output in form of
root files.

If you are a user of EUTelescope and you have already taken data and
performed you analysis, we would be very interested in obtaining a
data sample with the corresponding analysis results including the
EUTelescope configuration used so that we can include your analysis in
the regular testing. This guarantees that your analysis will be well
supported in future releases of EUTelescope and it might serve as a
good starting point for others.

The test can also be used by any developer who wishes to verify
changes made to the EUTelescope code. This is a short how-to; for more
detailed information see the CMake manual or web page
(http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest).

PREREQUISITES: in order to be able to run static code analysis tests
you will need to install cppcheck (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcheck/). 
To run the stattest program under *SL5.8*, you will also have to install
the package "giflib"; while *Ubuntu* requires you to have python-dev installed 
at ROOT compile time in order for the ROOT python libraries to be built.

To see which tests are available, enter the build directory of
EUTelescope and run
	   ctest -N

To perform a specific test of the list, run 
   	   ctest -I [START #],[END #]

where 'START #' is the test number to start from and 'END #' is the
(optional) last test to run. The tests will be run in build/Testing,
where each test has its own sub directory. Usually, the first testing
steps will set up this directory structure. If you have run the tests
once, you can therefore easily perform just specific tests that are
affected by code changes that you want to verify.

If you want to see the full output of the tests that have failed you
need to export the following environment variable:
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=true
or use
ctest -V
to see all output.

The end results of the analysis are verified using statistical tests
provided by ROOT and accessed through the Python scripts in
test/stattest/bin.

The tests can be run by anybody but require access to the data files
which reside on DESY AFS. If you wish to access the files please
contact the EUTelescope software coordinators.
